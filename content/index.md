My name is Kenneth Heimer. At the time of writing I am 27 years old. I was born in Skövde, but grew up in the Stockholm area, in the port town of Nynäshamn for the most part. A few years back I moved to Örebro, where I currently reside.

Given that this page is part of a course at BTH, I am, as you might expect, currently a student at Blekinge Tekniska Högskola. More specifically I'm studying this object oriented php course as part of a long distance course package.

For now, I'm not really sure what else to put here, I'm a man of few words.
